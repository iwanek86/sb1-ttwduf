  {
    question: 'What is bond order?',
    answer: 'Bond order is a measure of the number of chemical bonds between atoms in a molecule. It is calculated as half the difference between bonding and antibonding electrons. Higher bond orders indicate stronger and shorter bonds.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How is bond order calculated?',
    answer: 'Bond order is calculated using the formula: (number of bonding electrons - number of antibonding electrons) รท 2. The result indicates the effective number of bonds between atoms.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What do different bond orders mean?',
    answer: 'A bond order of 1 indicates a single bond, 2 indicates a double bond, and 3 indicates a triple bond. Fractional bond orders are possible and suggest intermediate bond strengths.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does bond order affect stability?',
    answer: 'Higher bond orders generally indicate greater molecular stability due to stronger bonds. However, very high bond orders can sometimes lead to increased reactivity in certain molecules.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are antibonding electrons important?',
    answer: 'Antibonding electrons weaken chemical bonds by occupying molecular orbitals that oppose bonding. They reduce the effective bond order and therefore the bond strength between atoms.'
