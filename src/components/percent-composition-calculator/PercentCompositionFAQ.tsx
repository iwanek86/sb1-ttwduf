  {
    question: 'What is percent composition?',
    answer: 'Percent composition is the mass percentage of each element in a chemical compound. It shows how much of the compound\'s total mass is contributed by each element.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you calculate percent composition?',
    answer: 'To calculate percent composition, divide the mass of each element in one mole of the compound by the compound\'s total molar mass, then multiply by 100. The formula is: (element mass รท total mass) ร 100%.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is percent composition important?',
    answer: 'Percent composition helps identify unknown compounds, verify sample purity, determine empirical formulas, and understand the relative abundance of elements in compounds. It\'s essential for chemical analysis and quality control.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What affects percent composition?',
    answer: 'Percent composition depends on the atomic masses of the elements and their ratios in the compound. It remains constant for a pure compound but can vary in mixtures or if impurities are present.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this used in real applications?',
    answer: 'Percent composition is used in quality control of chemicals, environmental analysis, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and materials science. It helps verify product composition and ensure manufacturing consistency.'
  }
