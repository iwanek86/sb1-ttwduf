      question: 'What is pH?',
      answer: 'pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, indicating how acidic or basic it is. The scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I interpret pH values?',
      answer: 'Values below 7 are acidic, 7 is neutral, and values above 7 are basic (alkaline). Each whole number represents a tenfold change in acidity or alkalinity.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is pOH?',
      answer: 'pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration. It complements pH, and their sum always equals 14 in water at 25Â°C.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why is pH important?',
      answer: 'pH is crucial in many fields including chemistry, biology, medicine, agriculture, and industry. It affects chemical reactions, biological processes, and product quality.'
